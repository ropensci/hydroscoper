## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:
* omit the redundant "R" in `Title: R Interface to Hydroscope`
* omit "[Hydroscope]" in Description:
```
Description: R interface to the  Greek National Data Bank for Hydrological
   and  Meteorological Information,
   [Hydroscope](<http://www.hydroscope.gr/>). It  covers most of
   Hydroscope's sources and provides functions to transform
   these untidy data sets into tidy dataframes.
```


## Test environments
* local windows 10 install, R 3.4.3
* travis.ci Linux, x64, R 3.4.3
* ci.appveyor, R 3.4.3
* win-builder (devel and release)
