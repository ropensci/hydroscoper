`hydroscoper` is an R interface to the  Greek National Data Bank for Hydrological and Meteorological Information,
*Hydroscope*. For more details checkout the package's [website](https://docs.ropensci.org/hydroscoper/) and the vignettes:

 * [An introduction to `hydroscoper`](https://docs.ropensci.org/hydroscoper/articles/intro_hydroscoper.html) with details about the Hydroscope project and the package.
 * [Using `hydroscoper`'s data sets](https://docs.ropensci.org/hydroscoper/articles/stations_with_data.html) with a simple example of how to use the package's internal data sets.
 
## Installation

Install the stable release from CRAN with:

```{r cran_installation, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("hydroscoper")
```

You can install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r gh-installation, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ropensci/hydroscoper")
```

## Using hydroscoper

The functions that are provided by `hydroscoper` are:

* `get_stations, get_timeseries, ..., etc.` family functions, to retrieve tibbles with Hydroscope's data for a given data source.
* `get_data`, to retrieve a tibble with time series' values.  
* `hydro_coords`, to convert Hydroscope's points' raw format to a tibble.
* `hydro_translate` to translate various terms and names from Greek to English.

The data sets that are provided by `hydroscoper` are:

* `stations` a tibble with stations' data from Hydroscope.
* `timeseries` a tibble with  time series' data from Hydroscope.
* `greece_borders` a tibble with the borders of Greece.

## Example

This is a minimal example which shows how to get the station's *200200* precipitation time series *56*  from the *kyy* sub-domain.

Load libraries and get data:

```{r load_libraries, eval = chk_online}
library(hydroscoper)
library(tibble)
library(ggplot2)

ts_raw <- get_data(subdomain = "kyy", time_id = 56)
ts_raw
```

Let's create a plot:

```{r plot_time_series, eval = chk_online}
ggplot(data = ts_raw, aes(x = date, y = value))+
  geom_line()+
  labs(title= "30 min precipitation for station 200200",
       x="Date", y = "Rain height (mm)")+
  theme_classic()
```
