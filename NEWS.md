  - Add vignettes "An introduction to `hydroscoper`" and  "Using `hydroscoper`'s data".
  - Add package documentation site.
  - Use pingr package to check if a sub-domain is alive.
  - All the functions return tibbles.
  - Add `greece_borders` dataset.

  - `get_instruments()` returns a tibble with the instruments' data.
  - `get_water_basins()` returns a tibble with the Water Basins' data.
  - `get_water_divisions()` returns a tibble with the Water Divisions' data.
  - `get_political_divisions()` returns a tibble with the Political Divisions' data.

* Changes

  - `get_stations` and `get_timeseries` use the Enhydris API and are considerably faster.
  - `get_data` uses lower case variable naming: `date, value, comment`

* Defuncs

  - `get_coords` has been removed from the package. Please use `hydro_coords` to convert Hydroscope's points' raw format to a tibble.
